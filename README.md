# HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

1. Download the entire folder "mednet-coding-challege-2024".

2. Open the "converter-project" folder and the "converter-server" folder (in my case with VSCODE).

3. Open a new terminal in the server folder location and run "node server.js". The server will be running on "https://localhost:3000/api".

4. Open a new terminal in the project folder location and run "ng test" to run unit tests or "ng serve" to start the app. The project will be running on "https://localhost:4200".
