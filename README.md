# HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

1. Download the entire folder "mednet-coding-challege-2024" (zip).

2. Open the "converter-project" folder and the "converter-server" folder (in my case with VSCODE).

3. Open a terminal in each folder location and run the "npm install" command in each location to download the required dependencies. 

4. Run the "npm start" command in the converter-server folder location. The server will be running on "https://localhost:3000".

5. In the unit-converter project folder location, run "ng test" to run unit tests or "ng serve" to start the app. The project will be running on "https://localhost:4200".
